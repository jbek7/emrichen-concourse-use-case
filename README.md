# emrichen-concourse-use-case
 
This repo is to reproduce the issue with emrichen:

`emrichen template.in.yaml > output.yaml`

- expected-output.yaml - this is what's expected by Concourse CI. And it was generated by !MultiInclude tag from my fork.
- too-many-values-error.in.yaml - `Merge` tag is throwing errors.
- IncludeGlob-produces-multi-arrays.yaml - it's not producing the format that concourse accepts, multi-array.
